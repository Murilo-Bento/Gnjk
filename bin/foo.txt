Since you're here, want a riddle?
Ok then. Here it goes:

You're on a island (No internet D:) with two kind of people. One kind only say truths and the other only tell lies.
You get to know two people: Breno and Gisleude.
When you first met Breno, he said: "I'm a different kind of Gisleude!"
And, when you first met Gisleude, he said: "Only a liar says Breno is a liar!"
Who is lying and who is telling the truth?

...
When you beat the riddle, try to figure out what GNJK means!
